      <li>2 cups jasmine rice</li>
      <li>2 cups chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups water</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons butter, divided, or more to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons sesame seeds, or to taste</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>
      Place rice, chicken stock, and water in a medium saucepan; bring to a
      boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until tender and liquid has
      been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Remove from the heat, stir in 2 tablespoons butter, and let cool to room
      temperature, about 30 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add eggs and scramble,
      stirring often to chop chunks of egg into small bits with a spatula.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>Place rice in a large mixing bowl, add eggs, and toss together.</p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in a large frying pan over medium-high
      heat. Dump rice mixture into the hot pan. Add sesame seeds, 2 tablespoons
      soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Taste and add more butter or soy sauce as desired. Serve.</p>
